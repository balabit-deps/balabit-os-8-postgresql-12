  * New upstream version (LP: #2085196).

    + This release encompasses changes from upstream's 12.21 and 12.22
      releases.  The former contains fixes for 4 CVEs (among other
      things), and the latter was hotfix for a problem caused by one of
      the CVE fixes from 12.21.

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 12.X.

    + However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 12.18, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Ensure cached plans are marked as dependent on the calling role when
      RLS applies to a non-top-level table reference (Nathan Bossart)

      If a CTE, subquery, sublink, security invoker view, or coercion
      projection in a query references a table with row-level security
      policies, we neglected to mark the resulting plan as potentially
      dependent on which role is executing it.  This could lead to later query
      executions in the same session using the wrong plan, and then returning
      or hiding rows that should have been hidden or returned instead.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Wolfgang Walther for reporting this
      problem.
      (CVE-2024-10976)

    + Make libpq discard error messages
      received during SSL or GSS protocol negotiation (Jacob Champion)

      An error message received before encryption negotiation is completed
      might have been injected by a man-in-the-middle, rather than being real
      server output.  Reporting it opens the door to various security hazards;
      for example, the message might spoof a query result that a careless user
      could mistake for correct output.  The best answer seems to be to
      discard such data and rely only on libpq's own report of the connection
      failure.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Jacob Champion for reporting this
      problem.
      (CVE-2024-10977)

    + Fix unintended interactions between SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
      and SET ROLE (Tom Lane)

      The SQL standard mandates that SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION have a
      side-effect of doing SET ROLE NONE.  Our implementation of that was
      flawed, creating more interaction between the two settings than
      intended.  Notably, rolling back a transaction that had done SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION would revert ROLE to NONE even if that had not been the
      previous state, so that the effective user ID might now be different
      from what it had been before the transaction.  Transiently setting
      session_authorization in a function SET clause had a similar effect.  A
      related bug was that if a parallel worker inspected
      current_setting('role'), it saw none even when it should see something
      else.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Tom Lane for reporting this problem.
      (CVE-2024-10978)

    + Prevent trusted PL/Perl code from changing environment variables
      (Andrew Dunstan, Noah Misch)

      The ability to manipulate process environment variables such as PATH
      gives an attacker opportunities to execute arbitrary code.  Therefore,
      trustedPLs must not offer the ability to do that.  To fix plperl,
      replace %ENV with a tied hash that rejects any modification attempt with
      a warning.  Untrusted plperlu retains the ability to change the
      environment.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Coby Abrams for reporting this problem.
      (CVE-2024-10979)

    + Restore functionality of ALTER {ROLE|DATABASE} SET
      role (Tom Lane, Noah Misch)

      The fix for CVE-2024-10978 accidentally caused settings for role to
      not be applied if they come from non-interactive sources, including
      previous ALTER {ROLE|DATABASE} commands and the PGOPTIONS environment
      variable.

  * New upstream version (LP: #2076183).

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 12.X.

    + However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 12.18, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Prevent unauthorized code execution during pg_dump (Masahiko Sawada)

      An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could inject
      SQL code that would be executed by a concurrent pg_dump session with the
      privileges of the role running pg_dump (which is often a superuser).
      The attack involves replacing a sequence or similar object with a view
      or foreign table that will execute malicious code.  To prevent this,
      introduce a new server parameter restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind that
      can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign
      tables, and teach pg_dump to set it when available.  Note that the
      attack is prevented only if both pg_dump and the server it is dumping
      from are new enough to have this fix.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

    + Fix INSERT from multiple VALUES rows into a target column that is a
      domain over an array or composite type (Tom Lane)

      Such cases would either fail with surprising complaints about
      mismatched datatypes, or insert unexpected coercions that could lead
      to odd results.

    + Fix incorrect pruning of NULL partition when a table is partitioned
      on a boolean column and the query has a boolean IS NOT clause (David
      Rowley)

      A NULL value satisfies a clause such as boolcol IS NOT FALSE, so
      pruning away a partition containing NULLs yielded incorrect answers.

  * New upstream version (LP: #2052850).

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 12.X.

    + However, one bug was fixed that could have resulted in corruption of
      GIN indexes during concurrent updates.  If you suspect such
      corruption, reindex affected indexes after installing this update.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 12.17, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Tighten security restrictions within REFRESH MATERIALIZED
      VIEW CONCURRENTLY (Heikki Linnakangas)

      One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under weak security
      restrictions.  If a materialized view's owner could persuade a
      superuser or other high-privileged user to perform a concurrent
      refresh on that view, the view's owner could control code executed
      with the privileges of the user running REFRESH.
      Fix things so that all user-determined code is run as the view's
      owner, as expected.

      The only known exploit for this error does not work in PostgreSQL
      16.0 and later, so it may be that v16 is not vulnerable in practice.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Pedro Gallegos for reporting this
      problem.

  * New upstream version (LP: #2040469).

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 12.X.

    + However, if you use GiST indexes, it may be advisable to reindex them.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 12.16, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Fix handling of unknown-type arguments in DISTINCT "any" aggregate
      functions (Tom Lane)

      This error led to a text-type value being interpreted as an unknown-type
      value (that is, a zero-terminated string) at runtime. This could result
      in disclosure of server memory following the text value.
      (CVE-2023-5868)

    + Detect integer overflow while computing new array dimensions
      (Tom Lane)

      When assigning new elements to array subscripts that are outside the
      current array bounds, an undetected integer overflow could occur in edge
      cases. Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable for arbitrary code
      execution are possible, and so is disclosure of server memory.
      (CVE-2023-5869)

    + Prevent the <literal>pg_signal_backend</literal> role from
      signalling background workers and autovacuum processes (Noah Misch,
      Jelte Fennema-Nio)

      The documentation says that pg_signal_backend cannot issue signals to
      superuser-owned processes. It was able to signal these background
      processes, though, because they advertise a role OID of zero. Treat that
      as indicating superuser ownership. The security implications of
      cancelling one of these process types are fairly small so far as the
      core code goes (we'll just start another one), but extensions might add
      background workers that are more vulnerable.

      Also ensure that the is_superuser parameter is set correctly in such
      processes. No specific security consequences are known for that
      oversight, but it might be significant for some extensions.
      (CVE-2023-5870)

    + Fix misbehavior during recursive page split in GiST index build
      (Heikki Linnakangas)

      Fix a case where the location of a page downlink was incorrectly
      tracked, and introduce some logic to allow recovering from such
      situations rather than silently doing the wrong thing.  This error
      could result in incorrect answers from subsequent index searches.
      It may be advisable to reindex all GiST indexes after installing
      this update.

    + Details about these and many further changes can be found at:
      https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/release-12-17.html.

  * d/p/libpgport-pkglibdir: Adjust patch to reflect upstream changes.

  * d/p/50-per-version-dirs.patch: Adjust TestLib.pm's
    scan_server_header and check_pg_config to account for
    unrelocatability of pg_config.
    These changes are needed because, during build time,
    we want to be able to run the upstream tests using the pg_config
    binary from inside the "debian/" directory, but that doesn't work out
    of the box because it will print includedir paths that also point to
    "debian/", instead of to "/usr/include".  Therefore, we need to catch
    this specific scenario and print the proper includedir paths instead.

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 12.X.

    + However, if you use BRIN indexes, it may be advisable to reindex them.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 12.10, see

    + Disallow substituting a schema or owner name into an extension script
      if the name contains a quote, backslash, or dollar sign (Noah Misch)

      This restriction guards against SQL-injection hazards for trusted
      extensions.

    + Fix confusion between empty (no rows) ranges and all-NULL ranges in
      BRIN indexes, as well as incorrect merging of all-NULL summaries
      (Tomas Vondra)

      Each of these oversights could result in forgetting that a BRIN
      index range contains any NULL values, potentially allowing
      subsequent queries that should return NULL values to miss doing so.

      This fix will not in itself correct faulty BRIN entries.
      It's recommended to REINDEX any BRIN indexes that
      may be used to search for nulls.

      visible even within a called function or script that attempted to set
      a secure search_path. This could allow any user having permission to

      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having
      row-level security policies, and it can be inlined into a calling
      query, those RLS policies would not get enforced properly in some
      cases involving re-using a cached plan under a different role. This
      could allow a user to see or modify rows that should have been
      invisible.

  * New upstream version (LP: #1950268).

    + Make the server reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake
      CVE-2021-23214

    + Make libpq reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake
      CVE-2021-23222

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 12.X.

    + However, note that installations using physical replication should
      update standby servers before the primary server, details in the
      release notes linked below.

    + Also, several bugs have been found that may have resulted in corrupted
      indexes, explained in detail in the release notes linked below. If any
      of those cases apply to you, it's recommended to reindex
      possibly-affected indexes after updating.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 12.6,
      see those release notes as well please.

    + Disallow SSL renegotiation more completely (Michael Paquier)

      SSL renegotiation has been disabled for some time, but the server
      would still cooperate with a client-initiated renegotiation request.
      A maliciously crafted renegotiation request could result in a server
      crash (see OpenSSL issue CVE-2021-3449).  Disable the feature
      altogether on OpenSSL versions that permit doing so, which are
      1.1.0h and newer.

  * New upstream version (LP: #1928773).

    + Prevent integer overflows in array subscripting calculations (Tom Lane)

      The array code previously did not complain about cases where an array's
      lower bound plus length overflows an integer.  This resulted in later
      entries in the array becoming inaccessible (since their subscripts could
      not be written as integers), but more importantly it confused subsequent
      assignment operations.  This could lead to memory overwrites, with
      ensuing crashes or unwanted data modifications. (CVE-2021-32027)

    + Fix mishandling of junk columns in INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... UPDATE
      target lists (Tom Lane)

      If the UPDATE list contains any multi-column sub-selects (which give
      rise to junk columns in addition to the results proper), the UPDATE path
      would end up storing tuples that include the values of the extra junk
      columns. That's fairly harmless in the short run, but if new columns are
      added to the table then the values would become accessible, possibly
      leading to malfunctions if they don't match the datatypes of the added
      columns.

      In addition, in versions supporting cross-partition updates, a
      cross-partition update triggered by such a case had the reverse problem:
      the junk columns were removed from the target list, typically causing an
      immediate crash due to malfunction of the multi-column sub-select
      mechanism. (CVE-2021-32028)

    + Fix possibly-incorrect computation of UPDATE ... RETURNING outputs for
      joined cross-partition updates (Amit Langote, Etsuro Fujita)

      If an UPDATE for a partitioned table caused a row to be moved to another
      partition with a physically different row type (for example, one with a
      different set of dropped columns), computation of RETURNING results for
      that row could produce errors or wrong answers.  No error is observed
      unless the UPDATE involves other tables being joined to the target
      table. (CVE-2021-32029)

  * New upstream version (LP: #1915254)
    + Fix incorrect detection of concurrent page splits while inserting
      into a GiST index (Heikki Linnakangas)

      Concurrent insertions could lead to a corrupt index with entries
      placed in the wrong pages.  It's recommended to reindex any GiST
      index that's been subject to concurrent insertions.

    + Fix CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to wait for concurrent prepared
      transactions (Andrey Borodin)

      At the point where CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY waits for all concurrent
      transactions to complete so that it can see rows they inserted, it
      must also wait for all prepared transactions to complete, for the
      same reason.  Its failure to do so meant that rows inserted by
      prepared transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing
      queries relying on the index to miss such rows. In installations that
      have enabled prepared transactions (max_prepared_transactions > 0),
      it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case
      this problem occurred when they were built.

    + Fix information leakage in constraint-violation error messages
      (Heikki Linnakangas)

      If an UPDATE command attempts to move a row to a different partition
      but finds that it violates some constraint on the new partition, and
      the columns in that partition are in different physical positions
      than in the parent table, the error message could reveal the contents
      of columns that the user does not have SELECT privilege on.

  * New upstream version.
    + Block DECLARE CURSOR ... WITH HOLD and firing of deferred triggers
      within index expressions and materialized view queries (Noah Misch)

      This is essentially a leak in the security restricted operation sandbox
      mechanism.  An attacker having permission to create non-temporary SQL
      objects could parlay this leak to execute arbitrary SQL code as a
      superuser.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Etienne Stalmans for reporting this
      problem. (CVE-2020-25695)

    + Fix usage of complex connection-string parameters in pg_dump,
      pg_restore, clusterdb, reindexdb, and vacuumdb (Tom Lane)

      The -d parameter of pg_dump and pg_restore, or the --maintenance-db
      parameter of the other programs mentioned, can be a connection string
      containing multiple connection parameters rather than just a database
      name.  In cases where these programs need to initiate additional
      connections, such as parallel processing or processing of multiple
      databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the basic
      connection parameters (database name, host, port, and username) were
      used for the additional connections.  This could lead to connection
      failures if the connection string included any other essential
      information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters. Worse, the
      connection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
      vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
      parameters would have prevented. (CVE-2020-25694)

    + When psql's \connect command re-uses connection parameters, ensure that
      all non-overridden parameters from a previous connection string are
      re-used (Tom Lane)

      This avoids cases where reconnection might fail due to omission of
      relevant parameters, such as non-default SSL or GSS options. Worse, the
      reconnection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
      vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
      parameters would have prevented. This is largely the same problem as
      just cited for pg_dump et al, although psql's behavior is more complex
      since the user may intentionally override some connection parameters.
      (CVE-2020-25694)

    + Prevent psql's \gset command from modifying specially-treated variables
      (Noah Misch)

      \gset without a prefix would overwrite whatever variables the server
      told it to.  Thus, a compromised server could set specially-treated
      variables such as PROMPT1, giving the ability to execute arbitrary shell
      code in the user's session.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Nick Cleaton for reporting this problem.

  * New upstream release (LP: #1892335).
    - Set a secure search_path in logical replication walsenders and apply
      workers (Noah Misch)

      A malicious user of either the publisher or subscriber database could
      potentially cause execution of arbitrary SQL code by the role running
      replication, which is often a superuser.  Some of the risks here are
      equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in
      this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute
      with empty search_path settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change
      might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated
      tables' DDL.)  Other risks are inherent in replicating objects that
      belong to untrusted roles; the most we can do is document that there is
      a hazard to consider.
      CVE-2020-14349

    - Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)

      Attacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried out
      against an extension installation script, if the attacker can create
      objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema of some
      prerequisite extension.  Since extensions often require superuser
      privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser
      privilege.  To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the search_path
      used to run an installation script; disable check_function_bodies within
      the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib
      modules to ensure they are secure.  Also provide documentation to help
      third-party extension authors make their installation scripts secure.
      This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on other
      extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly.
